            <h2>How We Create Custom GIS Solutions</h2>
            <p>One of the many advantages to a GIS is that it can be used across subject matters. At Ceratopsian Consulting, we aspire to provide solutions for multiple different industries. Rather than being a company that solely deals with natural resources, health, real estate, etc., we want to provide value everywhere. Our interests span across multiple different areas and we are always looking to apply the capabilities of GIS to new use cases.</p>
            
            <p>Spatial data makes up an important component of much of the information we consume on a daily basis, though it often goes unnoticed. Unfortunately this means that many insights are left uncovered. For instance, spatial analysis can be conducted in many different types of endeavors. It can help figure out the best location for a new health facility, what parcels of land need to be protected for the endangered species, and can determine which neighborhoods have the highest percentages of lower income families in need of financial assistance. No matter what subject matter your data pertains, we want to discover if we can help you uncover the wealth of information spatial analysis can bring you.</p>
